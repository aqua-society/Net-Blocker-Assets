                                    <strong>(1) Can NetBlocker completely protect my privacy?</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>No - nothing can completely protect your privacy.
                                    NetBlocker will do its best, but it is limited by the fact it must
                                    use the VPN service.
                                    This is the trade-off required to make a firewall which does not
                                    require root access.
                                    The firewall can only start when Android "allows" it to start,
                                    so it will not offer protection during early boot-up (although
                                    you can disable your network before rebooting).
                                    It will, however, be much better than nothing.</p>

                                <p>Android N and later allows NetBlocker to be an <a
                                        href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features/afw.html#always-on-vpn">Always-On
                                    VPN</a>.
                                    On Android O do not enable '<em>Block connections without
                                        VPN</em>', see <a href="#user-content-faq51">question 51</a>)
                                    for more information on this.</p>

                                <p>To protect yourself more, remember to disable Wi-Fi and mobile
                                    data before rebooting,
                                    and only enable them on reboot, after the firewall service has
                                    started (and the key icon is visible in the status bar).</p>

                                    <strong>(2) Can I use another VPN application while using
                                        NetBlocker</strong></p>

                                <p>If the VPN application is using the <a
                                        href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService.html">VPN
                                    service</a>,
                                    then no, because NetBlocker needs to use this service. Android
                                    allows only one application at a time to use this service.</p>

                                <p>NetBlocker is a firewall application, so there is no intention to
                                    add VPN support.
                                    However, NetBlocker supports a <a

                                        proxy</a> to chain VPN applications.</p>

                                </p>

                                <p>No, the minimum required Android version is 5.1 (<a
                                        href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop">Lollipop</a>)

                                    <strong>(4) Will NetBlocker use extra battery power?</strong></p>

                                <p>By default NetBlocker will hardly use any battery power.
                                    All settings resulting in extra battery usage, like IP filtering
                                    and logging, have a warning.
                                    If NetBlocker uses a lot of battery power, please double check
                                    your settings.</p>

                                <p>The battery usage when IP filtering is enabled depends on the
                                    quality of your Android VPN service implementation and the
                                    efficiency of the processor of your device.
                                    Generally the battery usage on older devices might be
                                    unacceptable, yet hardly noticeable on modern devices with an
                                    efficient processor.</p>

                                <p>The network speed graph notification will use extra battery
                                    power.
                                    This is why the notification is shown only when the screen is
                                    on.
                                    You can decrease the update frequency using the settings to
                                    reduce the battery usage.</p>

                                <p>Note that Android often incorrectly contribute battery usage of
                                    other apps to NetBlocker,
                                    because the network traffic of other apps is flowing through
                                    NetBlocker.
                                    This means that it might look like NetBlocker is using a lot of
                                    battery power,
                                    but that in fact the total battery usage of all apps is still
                                    the same.</p>

                                        external (VPN) server?</strong></p>

                                <p>No, depending on the mode of operation basically one of two
                                    things will happen with your internet traffic:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>When IP filtering is disabled, blocked internet traffic will
                                        be routed into the local VPN service, which will operate as
                                        a sinkhole (in effect dropping all blocked traffic)
                                    </li>

                                    <li>When IP filtering is enabled, both blocked and allowed
                                        internet traffic will be routed into the local VPN service
                                        and only allowed traffic will be forwarded to the intended
                                        destination (and not to a VPN server)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Internet permission can be granted with each application update
                                    without user consent.
                                    By showing all applications, NetBlocker allows you to control
                                    internet access even <em>before</em> such an update occurs.</p>

                                        app to work?</strong></p>

                                <p>You need 3 packages (applications) enabled (use search in
                                    NetBlocker to find them quickly):</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>com.android.vending (Play store)</li>

                                    <li>com.google.android.gms (Play services)</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p>Since the Google Play™ store app has a tendency to check for
                                    updates or even download them all by itself (even if no account
                                    is associated),
                                    one can keep it in check by enabling "<em>Allow when device in
                                        use</em>" for all 3 of these packages.
                                    Click on the down arrow on the left side of an application name
                                    and check that option,
                                    but leave the network icons set to red (hence blocked). The
                                    little human icon will appear for those packages.</p>

                                <p>Note that NetBlocker does <em>not</em> require any Google service
                                    to be installed.</p>

                                <p>The VPN service will be restarted when you turn the screen on or
                                    off and when connectivity changes (Wi-Fi, mobile)
                                    to apply the rules with the conditions <em>'Allow when screen is

                                <p>No, because if Tasker is allowed to disable NetBlocker, any
                                    application can disable NetBlocker.
                                    Allowing a security application to be disabled by other
                                    applications is not a good idea.</p>

                                <p>It isn't. NetBlocker doesn't allocate any memory, except a little
                                    for displaying the user interface elements and for buffering
                                    traffic.
                                    It appears, on some Android variants, that the Google Play™
                                    store app connection uses almost 150 MB. It is needed for in-app
                                    donations,
                                    and is incorrectly attributed to NetBlocker instead to the Google

                                <p>NetBlocker requires at least Android 5.1, so it is not available in

                                        access?</strong></p>

                                <p>If you block internet access for an application, there is no way
                                    around it.
                                    However, applications could access the internet through other
                                    (system) applications/components.
                                    For example, Google Play services receives incoming push
                                    messages and ads for most applications, including WhatsApp and
                                    Facebook messenger.
                                    You can prevent this by blocking internet access for the other
                                    application/component as well.
                                    You can block system applications and components, like Google
                                    Play services, by enabling the advanced NetBlocker option <em>Manage
                                        system apps</em>.
                                    This can best be diagnosed by checking the global access log
                                    (three dot menu, <em>Show log</em>).</p>

                                <p>Note that some applications keep trying to access the internet,
                                    which is done by sending a connection request packet.
                                    This packet goes into the VPN sinkhole when internet access for
                                    the application is blocked.
                                    This packet consists of less than 100 bytes and is counted by
                                    Android as outgoing traffic
                                    and will be visible in the speed graph notification as well.</p>

                                <p>Yes, but you'll need to enable subnet routing and tethering in
                                    the NetBlocker network settings.
                                    Whether or not it works depends on your Android version
                                    because some Android versions have a bug preventing tethering
                                    and the VPN service working together.</p>

                                <p>Some devices hibernate Wi-Fi, preventing tethering from working
                                    when the screen is off.
                                    This behavior can be disabled in the Android enhanced/advanced

                                <p>Android can kill background services at any time.
                                    This can only be prevented by turning a background service into
                                    a foreground service.
                                    Android requires an ongoing notification for all foreground
                                    services
                                    to make you aware of potential battery usage (see <a
                                            href="#user-content-faq4">question 4</a>).
                                    So, the notification cannot be removed without causing
                                    instability.
                                    However, the notification is being marked as low priority,
                                    which should result in moving it to the bottom of the list.</p>

                                <p>The Google connectivity services system application checks if the

                                    This is probably accomplished by briefly connecting to some

                                    other way around). On Android 6.0 and later you might get a

                                </p>

                                <p>Unless you are just testing NetBlocker, there is no current reason
                                    to use them both, since they cover the same function (firewall),
                                    although with different base needs (AFWall+ needs a rooted
                                    device) and ways of doing their thing (AFWall+ uses iptables
                                    whereas NetBlocker uses a VPN).</p>

                                <p>Also you need to keep per application access rules
                                    <em>always</em> in sync between AFWall+ and NetBlocker,
                                    else the application will not be able to access the network,
                                    hence bringing another level of complexity when setting and
                                    assuring everything work as expected.</p>

                                <p>Some pointers on how to set up AFWall+ to be used simultaneously
                                    with NetBlocker:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>if not using filtering in NetBlocker, applications
                                        <em>need</em> direct internet access (Wi-Fi and/or mobile)
                                        in AFWall+
                                    </li>

                                    <li>if using filtering, NetBlocker will <em>need</em> internet
                                        access (Wi-Fi and/or mobile) in AFWall+
                                    </li>

                                    <li>if using filtering, when you un/reinstall NetBlocker, remember
                                        to re-allow NetBlocker in AFWall+
                                    </li>

                                    <li>if using filtering, applications <em>need</em> VPN internet
                                        access (check the box to show that option in AFWall+
                                        settings)

                                    <strong>(31) Why can some applications be configured as a group
                                        only?</strong></p>

                                <p>For many purposes, including network access, Android groups
                                    applications on UID and not on package/application name.
                                    Especially system applications often have the same UID, despite
                                    having a different package and application name; these are set
                                    up like this by the ROM manufacturer at build time.
                                    These applications can only be allowed/blocked access to the
                                    internet as a group.</p>

                                    <strong>(32) Why is the battery/network usage of NetBlocker so
                                        high?</strong></p>

                                <p>This is because Android counts battery and network usage which is
                                    normally counted for other applications
                                    against NetBlocker in IP filtering mode. The total battery usage
                                    is slightly higher when IP filtering mode is enabled.
                                    IP filtering mode is always enabled on Android versions prior to
                                    5.0, and optionally enabled on later Android versions.</p>

                                    <strong>(33) Can you add profiles?</strong></p>

                                <p>Profiles are inconvenient because they need to be operated
                                    manually.
                                    Conditions like '<em>When screen is on</em>' are, on the other
                                    hand, convenient because they work automatically.
                                    Therefore profiles will not be added, but you are welcome to
                                    propose new conditions;
                                    however, they need to be generally usable to be included.</p>

                                <p>As a workaround you can use the export/import function to apply
                                    specific settings in specific circumstances.
                                    Alternatively, you can use lockdown mode as a profile.</p>

                                <p>Recent Android versions do not allow an application to query if
                                    other applications are in the foreground/background or

                                    As a result, this cannot be added without significant

                                    <strong>(35) Why does the VPN not start?</strong></p>

                                <p>NetBlocker "asks" Android to start the local VPN service,
                                    but some Android versions contain a bug which prevents the VPN
                                    from starting (automatically).
                                    Sometimes this is caused by updating NetBlocker.
                                    Unfortunately this cannot be fixed by NetBlocker.
                                    You can try to restart your device and/or revoke the VPN
                                    permissions from NetBlocker using the Android settings.
                                    Sometimes it helps to uninstall and install NetBlocker again (be
                                    sure to export your settings first!).</p>

                                <p>Since turning off the VPN service using the Android settings
                                    cannot be prevented,
                                    there is little use in adding PIN or password protection.</p>

                                    <strong>(37) Why are the pro features so expensive?</strong></p>

                                <p>The right question is "<em>why are there so many taxes and
                                    fees</em>":</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>VAT: 25% (depending on your country)</li>

                                    <li>Google fee: 30%</li>

                                    <li>Income tax: 50%</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>So, what is left for the developer is just a fraction of what you
                                    pay.</p>

                                <p>Despite NetBlocker being <em>really</em> a lot of work, only some
                                    of the convenience and advanced features need to be purchased,
                                    which means that NetBlocker is basically free to use
                                    and that you don't need to pay anything to reduce your data
                                    usage, increase battery life, and increase your privacy.</p>

                                <p>Also note that most free applications will appear not to be
                                    sustainable in the end, whereas NetBlocker is properly maintained
                                    and supported,
                                    and that free applications may have a catch, like sending
                                    privacy sensitive information to the internet.</p>

                                <p>On most devices, NetBlocker will keep running in the background
                                    with its foreground service.
                                    On some devices (in particular some Samsung models), where there
                                    are lots of applications competing for memory, Android may still
                                    stop NetBlocker as a last resort.
                                    Some Android versions, in particular of Huawei (see <a
                                            href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2016/07/04/push-notifications-not-coming-through-to-your-huawei-phone-heres-how-to-fix-it/">here</a>

                                    for a fix) stop apps and services too aggressively.
                                    Unfortunately this cannot be fixed by NetBlocker, and can be
                                    considered a shortcoming of the device and/or as a bug in
                                    Android.
                                    As a matter of fact lots of apps suffer from this, see <a

                                    You can workaround this problem by enabling the watchdog in the
                                    NetBlocker advanced options to check every 10-15 minutes.</p>

                                    <strong>(44) I don't get notifications on access</strong></p>

                                <p>To prevent a high number of status bar notifications, notify on
                                    access is done only once per domain name per application.
                                    Access to domain names shown in the application access log
                                    (drill down in the NetBlocker application settings) will not be
                                    notified again,
                                    even if you just enabled notify on access.
                                    To get notified for all domain names again, you can clear the
                                    application access log using the trashcan icon.
                                    If you want to clear all applications logs, you can export and
                                    import your settings.</p>

                                <p>Another reason why you don't get notifications could be an
                                    applied "Power Saving Mode" for example on Samsung devices. Even
                                    if you do not restrict CPU frequency in this mode.</p>

                                </p>

                                <p>The Android VPN service handles outgoing connections only (from
                                    applications to the internet), so incoming connections are
                                    normally left alone.</p>

                                <p>If you want to run a server application on Android, then be aware
                                    that using port numbers below 1024 require root permissions
                                    and that some Android versions contain routing bugs, causing
                                    inbound traffic incorrectly being routed into the VPN.</p>

                                    A good product deserves good support, which means, in practice,
                                    that I am spending 30-60 minutes each and every day answering
                                    questions and solving problems.
                                    Just about 1 in 1000 downloaders purchase any of the pro
                                    features, so support is basically one way.
                                    This is not maintainable in the long run and this is why
                                    advertisements were added.

                                <p>NetBlocker blocks traffic based on the IP addresses an application

                                    If more than one domain name is on the same IP, they cannot be
                                    distinguished.
                                    If you set different rules for 2 domains which resolve to the
                                    same IP, both will be blocked.</p>

                                <p>Another potential problem is that Android doesn't honor the DNS
                                    TTL value and applies its own caching rules.
                                    This could result in NetBlocker too early or too late purging a
                                    DNS record from its own cache,
                                    resulting in not recognizing an IP address or recognizing a
                                    wrong IP address.
                                    You can try to workaround this by changing the DNS TTL value
                                    setting of NetBlocker.
                                    This value is used as a minimum DNS TTL value in an attempt to
                                    mimick the behavior of Android.</p>

                                <p>NetBlocker is a firewall application that filters internet traffic

                                    so it is not meant to - and does not - encrypt your internet

                                <p>Yes, NetBlocker will automatically be started on boot if you
                                    powered off your device with NetBlocker enabled and NetBlocker is
                                    not installed on external storage.</p>

                                <p>Some devices, for example OnePlus and Mi devices, can prevent
                                    certain apps from auto-starting after reboot.
                                    This can be disabled in the Android settings.</p>

                                <p>Make sure you have put NetBlocker on the doze exception list
                                    (Android 6 Marshmallow or later)
                                    and that Android allows NetBlocker to use the internet in the
                                    background (see also <a href="#user-content-faq21">this
                                        question</a>).</p>

                                <p>Make sure you are not running NetBlocker in allow (whitelist) mode
                                    (check the NetBlocker default settings).</p>

                                <p>Make sure you didn't enable the Always-On VPN setting '<em>Block
                                    connections without VPN</em>' (Android 8 Oreo or later).
                                    This will block resolving domain names too (is it a bug or
                                    feature?).</p>

                                <p>Some Android versions, including LineageOS for some devices,
                                    contain a bug resulting in all internet traffic being blocked.
                                    Mostly, you can workaround this bug by enabling filtering in
                                    NetBlocker's <em>Advanced options</em>.
                                    If this doesn't solve the issue, the problem can unfortunately
                                    not be fixed or worked around by NetBlocker.</p>

                                        network?</strong></p>

                                <p>Tor with NetBlocker is only supported in the <a
                                        href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3233012">XDA
                                    NetBlocker forum</a>.
                                    There is no personal support on Tor with NetBlocker, because I
                                    don't use Tor myself.</p>

                                <p>First, install <a
                                        href="market://details?id=org.torproject.android">Orbot</a>,
                                    the Android client for Tor,
                                    run it, press <em>Start</em>, while it connects open its <em>Settings</em>
                                    and make sure it's setup to auto-start
                                    on device start.</p>

                                <p>In NetBlocker's <em>Network options</em> enable <em>Subnet
                                    routing</em> and in <em>Advanced options</em> toggle on
                                    <em>Use SOCKS5 proxy</em> with address 127.0.0.1 and port as
                                    9050 (this is the default port, if you changed
                                    this in Orbot make the adjustment here also).</p>

                                <p>This should be enough, if testing fails (eg. no connection at
                                    all) you can open the app details
                                    for Orbot, uncheck <em>Apply rules and conditions</em> and
                                    retry.</p>

                                <p>How to test: open Firefox (or another non-proxy enabled browser)
                                    to the address https://ipleak.net/
                                    and you should see a different IP address from your regular one,
                                    and below in the <em>Tor Exit Node</em>
                                    field something else besides <em>Unknown</em>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Be aware</strong> that all the other Tor caveats
                                    (https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en) still apply,
                                    like having the Tor network unreacheable, your activity actively
                                    monitored/targeted in your country,
                                    online services (eg. Gmail, Google Play store) failing to login
                                    or being forced to solve endless capchas
                                    when accessing sites that use Cloudflare's CDN services.</p>

                                        traffic?!</strong></p>

                                <p>NetBlocker can block each and every application, even system
                                    applications and components.</p>

                                <p>NetBlocker, by default, allows all traffic to prevent hard to find
                                    problems. You need to selectively block traffic yourself by
                                    tapping on the mobile or Wi-Fi icons.</p>

                                <p>Be aware that NetBlocker will allow traffic to an application when
                                    the screen is on and the condition <em>'when screen on'</em> is

                                    <strong>(57) Why does NetBlocker use so much data?</strong></p>

                                <p>Basically, NetBlocker doesn't use data itself.
                                    However, many Android versions incorrectly account data of other
                                    applications flowing through NetBlocker to NetBlocker instead of to
                                    the applications.
                                    The data usage of other applications will be zero with NetBlocker
                                    enabled in this case.</p>

                                <p>The total data usage of your device will be the same with and
                                    without NetBlocker.</p>

                                        time?</strong></p>

                                <p>The application list is provided by Android, so the loading speed
                                    depends mostly on the power of your device and on the efficiency
                                    of your Android version.
                                    For example shortage of memory could lead to increased loading
                                    times, because memory needs to be freed, for example by pausing
                                    other applications.</p>

                                <p>In some circumstances, restricting system apps and system
                                    components is known to cause the application list to load slowly
                                    or not at all. The exact circumstances are unknown.</p>

                                <p>Google manages all purchases, so as developer I have no control
                                    over purchases.
                                    So, the only thing I can do, is give some advice:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Make sure you have an active internet connection</li>

                                    <li>Make sure you didn't block Google Play store / Play
                                        services
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Make sure you are logged in with the right Google account
                                        and that there is nothing wrong with your Google account
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Open the Play store application and wait at least a minute
                                        to give it time to synchronize with the Google servers
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Open NetBlocker and navigate to the pro features screen;
                                        NetBlocker will check the purchases again
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    </li>

                                    <li>There is no time limit on purchases, so they cannot expire
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Google does not expose details (name, e-mail, etc) about
                                        buyers to developers
                                    </li>

                                    <li>An application like NetBlocker cannot select which Google
                                        account to use

                                <p>If you cannot solve the problem with the purchase, you will have
                                    to contact Google about it.</p>

                                    <strong>(63) Why is all DNS traffic allowed?</strong></p>

                                <p>NetBlocker blocks unlike any other Android firewall on real domain
                                    names.
                                    For this a list of domain names and IP address needs to be
                                    built.
                                    For this purpose, NetBlocker allows all DNS traffic, even if the
                                    domain name is listed in the hosts file.
                                    However, this doesn't mean traffic to the resolved IP address is
                                    allowed.</p>

                                <p>If you don't trust the system (Google's) or your provider's DNS
                                    servers, you can set alternative DNS servers in the advanced
                                    settings.
                                    Be sure to enter and confirm the addresses and to set two DNS

                                    If you enter just one DNS server address, it will be used in
                                    addition to the default DNS server addresses.</p>

                                    <strong>(64) Can you add DNS over TLS?</strong></p>

                                <p>If you mean to intercept <a
                                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS">DNS over
                                    TLS</a> requests to resolve domain names,
                                    this is not possible because DNS over TLS traffic is encrypted,
                                    which is the whole point of DNS over TLS.</p>

                                <p>If you mean to translate plain DNS to DNS over TLS, Android 9 Pie
                                    and later already support DNS over TLS out of the box,
                                    so it isn't worth the significant effort to add this.</p>
